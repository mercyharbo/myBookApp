## Overview

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add, remove and store a book to the localStorage 
- Get error message when the input is empty 
- Get a success message when you add, remove a book

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript 

## What I Learned

I learn a lot about localStorage, classes in JavaScript and also get to use constructor again after a while which I think I am going to using more often from now on just to understand it more and get back in it. I want to learn how to remove stored data from the localStorage as time goes now.
